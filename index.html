                    hello Im Ivan a computer Scince major at the University of Rhode Island,
                    I'm passionate about software development and working with servers. I love learning how things work behind the scenes—whether
                    it's backend systems, networking, or managing infrastructure. With hands-on 
                    experience in languages like C++, Python, Rust, and Bash, I enjoy building things that are both functional and efficient.
                    Outside of coding, I’m always down to explore new tech, work on personal projects, and find ways to optimize workflows.
                </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                Outside of career and academics, I enjoy playing video games, skating, watching anime, and lifting weights!
            </p>
